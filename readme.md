# Chrome Tab Switcher

CTS is a Chrome Plugin allowing for fast tab switching via a Popup Search Window.
As this extension is not on The Google Chrome Store yet, it canÂ´t be installed directly. However, it can still be used:
1. Clone this Repository
2. Navigate to the Repo Folder Root and do a `yarn / npm install`.
3. After succesfully completing the installation of the node modules, do a `yarn run build` to create a build for google chrome in the `/dist` folder.
4. Open Google Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
5. Make sure you have developer mode activated and load the `/dist` folder as a unzipped extension.
6. Have fun using CTS!
